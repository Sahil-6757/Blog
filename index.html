        <h2>Celebrating the Enlightened: Guru Nanak Jayanti</h2>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
      <p>
        Guru Nanak Jayanti, also known as Gurpurab, is a sacred and joyous
        occasion celebrated by Sikhs worldwide to honor the birth anniversary of
        Guru Nanak Dev Ji, the founder of Sikhism. This auspicious day falls on
        the full moon day in the month of Kartik, according to the Nanakshahi
        calendar.

      <p class="my-2">
        Life and Teachings of Guru Nanak Dev Ji:<br />
        Guru Nanak Dev Ji was born in 1469 in the village of Talwandi, now known
        as Nankana Sahib in present-day Pakistan. From a young age, Guru Nanak
        displayed a profound spiritual inclination. His teachings emphasize the
        oneness of God, equality, and the importance of selfless service.
      </p>

          alt=""
        />
      </div>

      <p class="my-2">
        1. Oneness of God (Ik Onkar): Guru Nanak preached the concept of "Ik
        Onkar," emphasizing the oneness of God and the interconnectedness of all
        creation. This foundational principle became the core of Sikh
        philosophy.
      </p>

      <p class="my-2">
        2. Equality and Brotherhood: Guru Nanak vehemently opposed
        discrimination based on caste, creed, or gender. He emphasized the
        equality of all human beings, referring to the entire human race as one.
      </p>

      <p class="my-2">
        3. Naam Japna, Kirat Karni, Vand Chakna: Guru Nanak advocated for the
        practice of Naam Japna (meditating on God's name), Kirat Karni (honest
        living and hard work), and Vand Chakna (sharing with others). These
        principles guide Sikhs towards a life of righteousness and compassion.

      <p class="my-2">
        1. Akhand Path: Devotees engage in the continuous recitation of the Guru
        Granth Sahib, the holy scripture of Sikhism, during a 48-hour non-stop
        reading known as Akhand Path.
      </p>
      <p class="my-2">
        2. Nagar Kirtan: Processions, known as Nagar Kirtan, are taken out,
        featuring hymn singing, martial arts displays, and the holy scripture
        being carried on a decorated float.
      </p>
      <p class="my-2">
        3. Gurdwara Decorations: Gurdwaras, Sikh places of worship, are adorned
        with lights, flowers, and colorful decorations. Devotees come together
        to participate in prayer sessions, kirtan (spiritual music), and langar
        (community kitchen).
      </p>
      <h3 class="text-center" style="color: orange">Impact on Society</h3>
      <p class="my-2">
        Guru Nanak's teachings have left an enduring impact on society. Sikhism
        promotes social justice, community service, and the welfare of all. The
        langar tradition, where free meals are served to everyone regardless of
        background, exemplifies the spirit of selfless service.
      </p>

      <p class="my-2">
        While Guru Nanak Jayanti holds profound significance for Sikhs, its
        celebration transcends religious boundaries. People from various
        communities participate in the festivities, recognizing the universal
        values preached by Guru Nanak.
      </p>
      <p class="my-2">
        In conclusion, Guru Nanak Jayanti is a time for reflection, prayer, and
        communal harmony. As the world comes together to honor the teachings of
        Guru Nanak Dev Ji, it serves as a reminder of the timeless wisdom that
        continues to inspire and guide countless individuals on their spiritual
        journey.
